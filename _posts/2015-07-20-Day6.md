## Day 6 - Dealing with realities creatively
After learning about the...limitations of a javascript hardware controller, it became apparant that my previous idea would be essentially impossible. Initially, I wanted to allow a user to draw on a Wacom tablet and have that drawing be interpreted and rendered on the cube. After learning that real-time interaction would be barred due to the javascript compiler, I decided that this might be a good opportunity to learn about web sockets. Instead of real-time interaction, users could access a webapp and draw an object with their mouse or finger. Then the app would send the object to the cube via websocket. 

I'll need to understand how to handle multiple websocket requests, and generally how to use websockets. I've been experimenting with HTML canvas for the past week, and will need to continue to understand how to handle various types of events, especially mouse events. 

Finally, I need to understand how wifi works on the Tessel, how to push scripts to wifi, and then how to map the 2-dimensional drawing to the 3-dimensional cube.

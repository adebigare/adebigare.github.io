## Project Thoughts
### Day 3 - 7/15/2105
My biggest challenge might be having too many ideas, or directions that I'd like to explore, and note enough time. But potentially the truncated timeline will actually be better for my decision-making process. Usually I work best under pressure. 

The more I turn the options over in my mind, I think data and story are where I'd like to focus my attention. Making a tool or a web-app is interesting in a different way. But the task seems too large for the time alotted, and anyway I find myself gravitating towards animations and micro-interactions, rather than the more complex systems that an app would require. 

However, I'm also still intrigued by the opportunity to do some hardware programming. I keep wondering if there's a way to tie the two things together, and make some kind of real world interaction component to coincide with the story. I've seen some interesting examples on the Tessel website [like this library for interacting with a Nintendo controller] (https://tessel.hackster.io/sidwarkd/tessel-nes-diy-module) that could provide an interesting crossroads between software and hardware. The real question is time. 

The challenge now is to pick a set of data that seems interesting, with maybe a sidelong glance to how I might make it multi-modal with the Tessel. I've tried to work with data before, and know how messy it can be and how quickly cleaning it can eat up hours or days of time. But it always seems like the best or most interesting datasets are also the messiest. An alternative would be to generate a proof of concept in class, and continue working after class is done.
